# Java-Phrase-O-Matic
Basic Java practice program that creates three arrays of random words, finds how many words are in each list, then combines it with three random numbers to print a complete phrase in the command line

This program idea comes from the 2nd Edition of "Head First Java" Programming Textbook

To run, ensure you have the latest version installed on your device. Navigate to the directory where the java file is stored, and in the terminal, run "Java PhraseOMatic"
